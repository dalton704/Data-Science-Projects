<p>In this repository I learned how to use Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Shiny, amd Power BIv.</p>

<h2>Univariate and Bivariate Analysis</h2>
<p>In this project I used the Diamonds data set to do Univariate and Bivariate analysis. I used Jupyter Notebook in order to do the analysis. For the Univariate analysis i was analyzing the total number of carrots per cut, and the range of prices. For the Bivariate analysis I was looking at the mean price of each cut per color.</p>
<br>
<h2>Linear Regression</h2>
<p>In this project I used Jupyter Notebook to make a linear regression line for an Insurance data set. I made a test set and training set of data from the insurance data set. I used the training set to predict the linear regression line.</p>
<br>
<h2>Iris</h2>
<p>Iris is made with RStudio and Shiny. It is an interactive application that will feature the 3 different iris species, Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. With the interactive application you are able to switch between each of the species and see a picture of the iris whenever you change your selection.</p>
